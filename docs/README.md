# Getting Started

This documentation contains sections for both FTC and FRC alongside explanations for advanced robot control concepts. 

!> It's important that you understand how different SHPLib/WPILib classes work before using them. Having a strong understanding of control concepts before using their respective classes will avoid any confusion or issues further down the line.

## FTC

> **What is FTC?**

FTC stands for *FIRST Tech Challenge*, a small-scale robotics challenge designed for 7th-12th graders. FTC teaches the fundamentals of robot control in simple cargo-based objectives.

> **I'm new to FTC programming, where do I get started?**

This documentation contains everything from setting power to a motor to utilizing complex closed loop control and kinematics. Feel free to head over the [FTC Overview](/ftc/) and begin following the guide.

## FRC

> **What is FRC?**

FRC stands for *FIRST Robotics Challenge*, a larger-scale robotics challenge designed for highschool students. FRC provides an industry-level robotics experience and uses [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html) as the primary library for programming robots in Java or C++ . FRC is <mark>very expensive</mark> to participate in, so it's crucial that you recognize it as a significant commitment and challenge yourself to learn and try new things.


> **I'm new to FRC programming, where do I get started?**

Head over to the [FRC Overview](/frc/) to get acclimated with [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html) and the current codebase.

## Advanced Concepts

This section contains explanations for different advanced concepts used both in FTC and FRC alongside their implementations in SHPLib. Most beginner programmers in FTC should attempt to learn some of these concepts and use them for their robot. These concepts are essential for a competitive FRC robot.
